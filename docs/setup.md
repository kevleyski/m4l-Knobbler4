### Setup

* Open Ableton Live
* Add the Knobbler device to a MIDI track
  * (I like to dedicate a track to it and keep it out of the way)
* Open the Knobbler app on your iPad
* Click "Rescan Network" in the Knobbler device in Ableton Live. Choose your iPad from the drop-down list.
* Back on the iPad, select your computer from the list
  * If you are seeing the "Nobody Home" message, pull down on the message to refresh. Your computer should show up after that.
* You should see a "Connection Success" message. From there, it's time to get to Knobblin'!

Next, check out all of Knobbler's [Features](./features).

If you're having trouble, then check out [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).
