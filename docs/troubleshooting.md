### Troubleshooting

#### I see a warning about control surfaces in the Knobbler device in Ableton Live. Halp!

Knobbler relies on some functionality of Ableton Live that it only enables when there is a Control Surface configured. To remedy the situation:

* Open Live's settings
* Click "Link, Tempo and MIDI"
* Under the Control Surface column, choose "ADVANCE".
* Close the settings window
* The warning should disappear

Note that many other choices in the Control Surfaces menu also work, but not all of them. The full list of working control surfaces can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-Knobbler4/refs/heads/main/control_surfaces.txt). Look for the ones with a "*" next to them.

#### I see a warning in the Knobbler iPad app about a compatible version of the device. Haaalp!

The Knobbler app and device are constantly being improved. By virtue of being an iPad app, the Knobbler app is likely set to auto-update. It is likely that a future version of the Knobbler iPad app requires functionality provided by a future version of the Knobbler device. 

When the Knobbler device first communicates with the iPad, it sends a version number. The iPad app has a minimum device version coded into it, and it will prompt you if it is communicating with a device that is too old.

Simply download the latest version of the device and install it as you normally would, by dragging it to the User Library in Ableton Live.

You can use the "Swap Device" function in Ableton live to switch from an older version to a newer version, with all of your mapping preserved.
